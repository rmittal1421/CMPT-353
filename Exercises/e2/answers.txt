Q1. In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? What is the type, and describe the values.
A. The values in the result of data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept are the y values (at every x) of the best fit line formed by this calculation where 
it follows the equation of a straight line y = mx + c where m is the slope of the line and c is the y-intercept (when x is 0). In terms of our calculations
related to dog tweets, with the help of this calculation, we are getting the predicted value of the rating at the corresponding timestamp. It does it by doing
the standard slope intersect calculation on each timestamp. The type of the result is a pandas series where every value is of type float.

Q2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?
A. We wanted to minimize the sum of squared distances between the generated line and the given data set to get the best fit line. 
scipy.stats.linregressdata(data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept) achieves this by calculating least square regression for two
sets of measurements. In our case, the given data set is the dog rating data provided. The least-squares regression for two sets of 
measurements is calculated by the above written calculation. 
To calculate the values of prediction, we required the created_at values ('x' value)  to be int or float however we had them in the form
of datatime object. Hence, we had to convert it to timestamp form so that we can calculate the prediction. So we can see that created_at
and timestamp are effectively similar values and hence they are paired correctly and we want to plot our rating values against the created_at
values for the ease of reading.
