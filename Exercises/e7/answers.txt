1. Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value? 
Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?
A. By looking at the histogram, it looks like the data is almost normal. Hence, it is fine to look at the OLS p-value.
The OLS p-value is <0.05 and hence we are confident that ratings are different. The slope of the best fit line is +ve
and hence we can conclude that ratings are infact increasing.

2. Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the
noise?
A. Yes, the new better prediction is letting kalman filtering do a better job since it is taking in the additional information
it knows (through machine learning) about the data and hence using it to predict the next state. Whereas, previously we were 
assuming that the state remains same because of which kalman filtering was considering a lot of true values as noise and hence
ignoring it. But with this better prediction, it is considering those fluctations as truth and gives a better plot.
