1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice?

-> In this case Kalman smoothing works better than LOESS. It represents the peaks and valey in the data better.



2. In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude? [Aside: I tried, and it didn't help much. I think the values are calculated from the latitude/longitude by the app: they don't really add much new information.]

-> The timestamp, course and speed may be used in kalmans smoothing calculations for better approximations. Kiltering takes velocity into account, hence both the course and the speed may be used in the filter. Timestamp would be the least effective.
