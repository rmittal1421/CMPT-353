1. Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task? Can you give a theory about why? Do you have any theory about
why RGB/LAB/HSV worked better for different models?
A.

2. Have a look at the cities in your validation data where the weather model makes the wrong prediction. Do you feel like
the model is making reasonable mistakes? Can you think of any weather features that we could potentially add to make better 
predictions?
A.
